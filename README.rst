PACMOF is a small and easy to use python library that uses machine Learning to quickly estimate partial atomic charges in
metal-organic frameworks. The pre-trained Random Forest model (Scikit-learn) in PACMOF generates high-quality charges of the same accuracy as that of
Density Derived Electrostatic and Chemical (DDEC), but without needing hours of periodic-DFT calculations. PACMOF is made with high-throughput screening
in mind, where you can get charges on a large number of CIF files in parallel, using a Dask_ backend with options to write the output charges into new CIF files, and to 
use a user-trained machine learning models instead of the pre-trained one (included). The inspiration for this work came from this recent paper_ published in the Physics Archives, 
where each atom in a MOF is described by a list of the elemental and the local environmental features. However, we chose a slightly different set of features to train our ML model namely,

- Electronegativity (elemental)
- First ionization energy (elemental)
- Number of atoms in the first coordination shell (local environment).
- The average electronegativity of the first coordination shell (local environment). 
- The average coordination distance of the coordinated atoms (local environment) .
- The average ionization energy of the first coordination shell (local environment).
- The average electronegativity of the second coordination shell (local environment).

Among these features, we found that the elemental electronegativity and the average electronegativity of the
first coordination shell are by far the most important features when it comes to predicting partial charges.

The relative feature importance is summarized in the figure below

Benchmarking the computation times
-----------------------------------
[contents_]

**Calculations in serial**

Figure below shows the comparison of the computation times of the ‘get_charges_singe_serial’ subroutine in PACMOF while estimating partial charges using an Intel Xeon E5-2680 CPU for 1700 MOFs in the benchmarking set, plotted as a function of the number of atoms in the unit cell. The color indicates the percentage of atoms in the unit cell with atomic number Z > 8, for which a more expensive neighbor finding algorithm (CrystalNN) had to be used.

.. figure:: ./docs/images/serial_only.jpg
   :width: 200

**High-throughput calculations in parallel**

We choose a small, random set of 1700 MOFs to benchmark PACMOF, 1652 of which have less than 1000 atoms in their unit cell. For convenience, we grouped these 1652 MOFs into 3 groups based on the number of atoms in their unit cell (Table 1) and used them to benchmark the parallel calculations. Groups 1 to 3 represent different high-throughput screening scenarios with materials with small (Group 1, < 200 atoms), medium (Group 2, 200-500 atoms) and moderately large (Group 3, 500 -1000 atoms) unit cells. We used these groups to benchmark the ‘get_charges_multiple_parallel’ subroutine in PACMOF. Given the large variety in CPU hardware and the process-thread combinations, we chose to use Intel Xeon E5-2680 CPUs with one process per CPU (one process per thread) consistently for all the benchmarking calculations. The figure below shows the total computation times of the get_charges_multiple_parallel subroutine in PACMOF for Groups 1 to 3 using Dask clusters of different CPU counts.  Groups 1 to 3 mimic different high-throughput screening scenarios with MOFs of small (<200 atoms) to moderately large (500-1000 atoms) unit cell sizes

.. figure:: ./docs/images/groups_timing.jpg
   :width: 200

This subroutine saves time by not having to reload the Scikit-learn model and is suitable for high-throughput screening (HTS) applications.  Each calculation is run 5 times and the error bars are calculated for a confidence interval of 95% (1.96 times the standard deviation). In general, the calculations run very fast, consuming only less than 6 minutes to compute the charges on all 1515 MOFs (Groups 1 and 2) and about 3 minutes for all 138 moderately large MOFs (Group 3) even on a small Dask cluster of 32 CPUs. Further significant speed ups of 35 %, 40 % and 27 % was observed for Groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively as the cluster sizes were increased from 32 CPUs to 80 CPUs in increments of  16 CPUs.

What can PACMOF do ?
---------------------

PACMOF calculates partial charges in MOFs in serial or parallel using CIF files as input. PACMOF uses a Dask_ backend to do calculations in parallel which is useful in processing large CIFs or for interactive high-throughput screening. All the functions return an ASE_ style atoms object (or a list of objects) with the features included under atoms.info['features'] dictionary and the charges (if calculated) included under the atoms.info['_atom_site_charges'] dictionary respectively. Functions are well documented in their docstrings and can be availed using 'help(function_name)'. The general capabilities of PACMOF can be summarized as follows:

Serial Calculations
--------------------

- Compute the features for any CIF, this might be useful for training your own machine learning model.

.. code-block:: python

    data = pacmof.get_features_from_cif_serial(path_to_cif)

- Compute the charges from a CIF file.

This is sufficient for most CIF files, where the number of atoms per unit cell is less than 2000.

.. code-block:: python

    data = pacmof.get_charges_single_serial(path_to_cif)

Parallel Calculations
----------------------

Since PACMOF uses a Dask_ backend, you can run calculations in parallel on a single CPU using Dask_ without starting a Dask cluster. If you plan on doing high-throughput screening with many CIF files on an HPC, you could start a Dask cluster before
calling any of the get_charges_multiple_parallel/onebyone functions to run calculations in parallel. For example, to start a cluster with 10 processes with 8 CPUs per process on an HPC that uses SLURM_ use,

.. code-block:: python

    from dask_jobqueue import SLURMCluster
    from dask.distributed import Client
    cluster=SLURMCluster(cores=8, interface='ib0', project='p20XXX', queue='short', walltime='04:00:00', memory='100GB')
    cluster.scale(10)
    client= Client(cluster)

   Note: Please refer to the dask documentation on setup_ for use with other queuing systems and more.

**The inner workings of parallel computing in PACMOF**

Note: For more info the function arguments, please refer to the source code file pacmof.py in PACMOF or use help(function_name).


Dask_ offers a following scheduler options for executing the task graphs for partial charge calculation.

+ *Threaded scheduler:* Not suitable for parallel calculations using objects due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python.
+ *Multi-processing scheduler:* Good for single CPU calculations with a few processes (workers) where the computation overhead from data sharing can be readily avoided.
+ *Distributed scheduler (preferred):* The most advanced of the Dask_ schedulers, provides versatility through concurrent futures_ . Large data such as the structure information might have to be pre-distributed to the processes to avoid any computational bottlenecks from data transfer. Allows for the use of the advanced Dask dashboard_ to keep track of the calculations in real-time.

PACMOF uses dask_bag_ for parallel computations, which defaults to the process-based scheduler, this is enough when using one or a few CPUs in parallel. If a  dask cluster is started beforehand, Dask_ detects that a cluster is active and automatically switches to the more robust distributed scheduler for its calculations. Further, all the parallel functions listed below support a *client_name* argument to specify the scheduler explicitly. The '*client_name*' is recommended to be one of the following:

- a object of the dask.distributed.Client type, like the 'client' variable initiated in the code snippet above. Uses the distributed_ scheduler
- Keyword 'processes' to use the process-based scheduler
- if no *client_name* is specified and no cluster is initiated, the process-based scheduler is used by default.

We recommend using the distributed scheduler always, and specifying the '*client_name*' explicitly to ensure robustness for calculations on both single machines and HPCs.

    Note: To use the distributed scheduler on the single CPU initialize a local cluster and then pass
    that as the client_name to the parallel routine in PACMOF

    .. code-block:: python


        from dask.distributed import Client, LocalCluster
        cluster=LocalCluster()
        client= Client(cluster)

        data = pacmof.get_charges_multiple_parallel(list_of_cifs, create_cif=False, client_name=client)



- Calculations on a large CIF with more than 2000 atoms

For CIFs with more than say 2000 atoms calculations in serial can be too slow, in those cases PACMOF can be used to calculate charges (or features) quickly in parallel for a single CIF file.


    - Compute the features for a large CIF in parallel using Dask_

    .. code-block:: python

        data = pacmof.get_features_from_cif_parallel(path_to_cif)


    - Compute the charges for a large CIF in parallel using Dask_

    .. code-block:: python

        data = pacmof.get_charges_single_large(path_to_cif, create_cif=False)
    
    Note: Please refer to the docstring from help() to see the options on writing the output CIF file and to use a different machine learning model other than the pre-trained one.

- Calculations on a list of CIFs in parallel

PACMOF can be used to run calculations on a list of CIFs in one line, where each calculation is run in serial or parallel depending on the number of atoms .

    - Compute the charges for a list of CIFs in parallel, on a single CPU or using a dask cluster. This is recommended for most cases. 

    .. code-block:: python

        data = pacmof.get_charges_multiple_parallel(list_of_cifs, create_cif=False)


    - Compute the charge for a list of large CIFs, one by one, where each calculation is run in parallel using Dask_. This is recommended when all of the CIFs have more than 2000 atoms each, if not the memory overhead for parallelizing might make the calculation slightly slower than the serial case.

    .. code-block:: python

        data = pacmof.get_charges_multiple_onebyone(list_of_cifs, create_cif=False)


    Note: As usual, you could use the serial functions and submit multiple jobs for different CIFs, however the functions above will save time by not reloading the ML model for individual CIF files.
